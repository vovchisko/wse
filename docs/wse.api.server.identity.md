## Usage

```javascript
server.when.joined((client, meta) => {
  console.log(`User ${client.cid} has ${client.conns.size} devices`)
  
  // Send to all user's devices
  client.send('welcome', { message: 'Hello from all your devices!' })
})

// Access specific connections
const client = server.clients.get('user-123')
